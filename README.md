# Teeworlds Docker

This Docker will download and install a simple Teeworlds Dedicated server with a autoexec.cfg, dm.cfg, tdm.cfg & ctf.cfg preconfigured (the only thing that need to be changed is the Server Name and the RCON Password in the autoexec.cfg).

***ATTENTION: Please don't delete the tar.gz file in the main directory!***

Update Notice: Simply restart the container if a newer version of the game is available and the container will download and install it.
